Drop your preferred "ashes" background image here as `ashes.jpg` (or `ashes.png`).

- Recommended size: 1920×1200 (or larger). The CSS uses `background-size: cover` and centers the image.
- File path: `frontend/public/ashes.jpg` (Vite serves files from `public/` at the project root as `/ashes.jpg`).

If no image is present, the page will gracefully fall back to the subtle programmatic texture already included in the styles.
